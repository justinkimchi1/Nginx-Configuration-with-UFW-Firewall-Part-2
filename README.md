# Nginx Project Part 2
Creating file servers using `nginx` and configuring a load balancer to them

## Task 1 Creating Droplets with `web` tag
1. Go to DigitalOcean and create two droplets with the tag `web`

## Task 2 Create Load Balancer for Droplets
On DigitalOcean, create a Load Balancer with these settings:
- Regional, San Francisco 3
- Default VPC Network
- Public Network Visibility
- `web` tag

## Task 3 Cloning Starter Code Repository
Clone starting code repository into your home directory:
```
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~nathan_climbs/2420-as3-p2-start
```

## Task 4 Server Configuration
Server Configuration will be done on both servers, meaning after finishing configuration on one server, please repeat the exact same steps in the second server.

We will break this task into several parts:
- Create system user and their directories
- Create `.service` and `.timer` scripts
- Configure `nginx` 
- Set up `ufw` firewall

### Create system user and their directories
1. Create a system user [[1]](#1-useradd-command)
```
sudo useradd -r -d /var/lib/webgen -s /usr/sbin/nologin webgen
```
- `-r`: creates system account
- `-d`: specifies users home directory
- `-s`: specifies users default shell, in this case we use `/usr/sbin/nologin` to prevent users from logging into the account

2. Create directories with `-p` option [[2]](#2-mkdir-command)
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/webgen
```
> This creates `webgen`'s home directory where we will create the other directories 
- `-p`: option creates parent directories as needed

Then create the other directories with this:
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/webgen/bin /var/lib/webgen/HTML /var/lib/webgen/documents
```
Now `cd` into the `2420-as3-p2-start` starter directory that we cloned in our home directory:
```
cd 2420-as3-p2-start
```
Give execute permissions to the `generate_index` file [[11]](#11-chmod-command):
```
sudo chmod +x generate_index
```

And move the `generate_index` file into your new directory with this:
```
sudo mv generate_index /var/lib/webgen/bin/
```
Now create document files:
```
sudo touch /var/lib/webgen/documents/file-one /var/lib/webgen/documents/file-two
```
You may add some text to the files:
```bash
# file-one
this is file one
```

```bash
# file-two
this is file two
```
After your file structure looks like this:
```
/var/bin/webgen/
 .
 ├── bin/
 │   └── generate_index
 ├── documents/
 │   ├── file-one
 │   └── file-two
 └── HTML/
```
You can give ownership of the directory to the `webgen` user [[3]](#3-chown-command)
```
sudo chown -R webgen:webgen /var/lib/webgen
```
- `-chown`: used to change user ownership of files
- `-R`: option to recursively change ownership of directories and their contents
- `webgen:webgen /var/lib/webgen`: assign webgen and the group webgen to the specified directory 

You have finished creating a system user with the appropriate directory structure and ownership!

### Creating `.service` and `.timer` scripts
1. Create the `generate-index.service` file 
```
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/system/generate-index.service
```
Paste the following into the script [[4]](#4-systemdtimers)
```bash
[Unit]
Description="Runs the generate_index script everyday at 5:00"

[Service]
ExecStart=/var/lib/webgen/bin/generate_index
User=webgen
Group=webgen
```
- `[Unit]`: section that provides information about the service. We have the description in there
- `[Service]`: section where we define the specifics about how the service should run. Here we give it the path to the file that we want to run and which user and group we want it to be run by

2. Create the `generate-index.timer` file
```
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/system/generate-index.timer
```

Paste this into the file [[4]](#4-systemdtimers)
```bash
[Unit]
Description="Run the generate-index.service at 5:00 am everyday"

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 5:00:00
Unit=generate-index.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```
- `[Unit]`: section that provides information about the service. We have the description in there
- `[Timer]`: section that we can define the scheduling of the timer. Here we set it to activate every day at 5:00 am. We also specify which unit to activate, which is our `generate-index.service` file
- `[Install]`: section that defines how the unit should be enabled within the `systemd` system. Here we tell `systemd` to automatically start our timer when it initializes `timers.target`, which is responsible for managing all timer units

3. Activate `generate-index.timer` file [[5]](#5-systemctl)
```
sudo systemctl start generate-index.timer
```
Enable it to boot on start as well
```
sudo systemctl enable generate-index.timer
```

4. Verify your timer is active and running
```
systemctl status generate-index.timer
```
When it says that your timer is active and (waiting), that means your timer is running

You can also use `journalctl` command to check the logs for the service [[6]](#6systemdjournal)
```
journalctl -u generate-index.service
```
You have created your service and timer files!

### Configure `nginx`
This entire section was made with the help of [Nginx ArchWiki](#7-nginx) and [Week 12 Notes](#8-week-twelve-notes).
1. Install `nginx`
```
sudo pacman -S nginx
```
2. Start and enable the service
```
sudo systemctl start nginx.service
sudo systemctl enable nginx.service
```
Check if it is active and running with 
```
systemctl status nginx.service
```

3. Modify the nginx configuration file
```
sudo nvim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
Here we have to configure the file so that it runs with our `webgen` user and that is serves our `index.html` file on port 80. To do this we first need to change `user` from `http` to `webgen`:
```bash
user webgen webgen
```
> This tells nginx to run the master process as `webgen`. This gives the configuration files the correct permissions to manage files in `webgen`'s directories

Add this line of code into you `http` section
```bash
http {
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
}
```
This helps load our other configuration files that we will make in the next steps

> Note: make sure to comment out any other server blocks that are in your default configuration file


4. Create server block directories
```
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/sites-available /etc/nginx/sites-enabled 
```

5. Create configuration file inside `sites-available` directory
```
sudo nvim /etc/nginx/sites-available/webgen.conf
```
Paste the following server block into the configuration file and give the `server_name` a name [[12]](#12-week-thirteen-notes)
```bash
server {
        # listening on port 80
        listen 80;
        # listening to HTTPS connections using IPv6
        listen [::]:80;

        # giving server a name
        server_name <name-or-ip>;

        # root directory of the /documents files
        location /documents {
            root /var/lib/webgen/;
            autoindex on; # Allows us to see all files and directories in the specified location
            autoindex_exact_size off; # displays the file sizes in a readable format
            autoindex_localtime on; # displays file timestamps of the server's local time
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404; # checks the existence of files and directories
        }

        # handling the default location request
        location / {
            root /var/lib/webgen/HTML;
            index index.html; # specify the index.html page
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

}
```

6. Create a symlink to enable the site
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/webgen.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
7. Restart your nginx service
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
You have configured your nginx server! 

> Some troubleshooting:

- Checking `webgen.conf` file for any errors: 
```
sudo nginx -t
```
- Checking the status of nginx:
```
systemctl status nginx
```
- Starting, enabling, restarting, stopping nginx:
```
systemctl start/enable/restart/stop nginx
```
- Checking journal log of service
```
sudo journalctl -u nginx
```

### Set up `ufw` firewall
Here we will set up a simple firewall and check the status of the firewall with `sudo ufw status` after we are done. [[9]](#9-uncomplicated-firewall)
1. Install UFW
```
sudo pacman -S ufw
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Do not enable the UFW service yet because it will lock us out of our droplet. Please follow the next steps first.

2. Enable `ssh` and `http` connection [[8]](#8-week-twelve-notes)
```
sudo ufw allow SSH
sudo ufw allow http
```
> If successful, you should see `Rules updated` and `Rules updated (v6)` in your terminal

3. Enable ssh rate limiting [[9]](#9-uncomplicated-firewall)
```
sudo ufw limit SSH
```
> This denies connections from ip addresses that have attempted to intiate 6 or more connections in the last 30 seconds

4. Enable the service. This step should only be done after completing steps 2 & 3!
```
sudo ufw enable 
```
You can check your firewall status with:
```
sudo ufw status
```
Your firewall should looks something like this:
```
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
SSH                        LIMIT       Anywhere
80                         ALLOW       Anywhere
SSH (v6)                   LIMIT       Anywhere (v6)
80 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

You have activated your firewall!

## Accessing your server
1. Access your server by entering your Load Balancers IP address into the web:
```
http://load-balancer-ip
```
Example:
```
http://143.198.247.222
```

After pressing enter you will be redirected to one of your servers html page:
![Default Page](./defaultpage.png)

2. To access /documents add the `/documents` next to the url
```
http://load-balancer-ip/documents
```

Example:
```
http://143.198.247.222/documents/
```
You should see something like this:
![Documents Page](./documentspagepng.png)
